# Hum-whistle-ML-project
•	Extracted three features from audio files named as RMS, ZCR and spectral centroid. After extracting these features they were trained individually on different machine learning algorithms. These features acted as base learner.

•	A meta learner was developed on top of these base learners. Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested on top of the base learners. Random forest classifier gave the best performance in terms of predictions.
